# Email Verification Project

## Process

1. Created initial project, set up version control, copied all-round .gitignore file which I use for iOS projects.
2. Created Model, ViewModel, Controller, View folders. In each folder a .gitkeep file was created in order to save folder structure in git.
3. Initialized a Cocoapods workspace.
4. Set explicit 11.2 requirement. No backward compatibility for the sake of brevity.
5. Created a basic UI layout. MasterController was wrapped in UINavigationController. Navigation bar got Cancel and Done buttons. UITableViewController was embedded in a container view added to MasterController. Default UITableView separators were disabled.
